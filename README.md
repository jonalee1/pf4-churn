**Churn Analysis Using Tree Ensembles**

Churn analysis is a critical process for telecom companies as it helps them identify customers who are likely to leave the service provider and take their business elsewhere. It involves analyzing customer behavior and usage patterns to identify factors that lead to churn and developing strategies to retain customers.  Churn analysis can leads to:

- Improved customer retention: Churn analysis helps telecom companies identify customers who are at risk of leaving and develop strategies to retain them, which can help improve customer retention rates
- Increased revenue: By retaining more customers, telecom companies can increase their revenue and profitability
- Improved customer satisfaction: Telecom companies can improve their overall customer satisfaction by analyzing customer data and identifying factors that lead to churn
- Competitive advantage: Telecom companies can gain a competitive advantage over their rivals by reducing churn rates and improving customer retention

 **Project Goals**

1. To build a predictive model for churn in the Telecom industry
2. To build a feedback loop to help maintain the quality of results

 **Data/Program Description**

The telecom company from the US provided the data with 98230 customers over 73 unique features. The features are related to customer demographics, personal information, and usage.

●    Language - Python, SQL

●    Cloud - AWS

We start by exploring the data helping us to create model-ready data. We will train various models such as logistic regression, random forest classifier, and xgboost classifier.  Finally, after the model is built we will check for data drift and model drift to monitor the model performance.
